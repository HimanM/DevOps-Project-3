# Note: This assumes Traefik is already installed and configured with a certificate resolver named "myresolver"
# If you need to define a TLSStore or other specific Traefik CRDs, add them here.
# For example, a default TLSStore:
apiVersion: traefik.containo.us/v1alpha1
kind: TLSStore
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: fullstack
spec:
  defaultCertificate:
    secretName: fullstack-tls-cert # You would need to create this secret or rely on CertManager/Traefik to create it
